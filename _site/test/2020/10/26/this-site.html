        <p>This website is a big project that required a lot of work, of testing, of learning and of researching.
<!--more-->
It took me a lot of work because it’s conception involved some tools I didn’t know existed, some I only used once, and all of these tools, programming languages, frameworks wouldn’t stop fighting together, making it hard to force them to work together. It was really frustrating beacause I made a lot of <em>fails</em>, but I’m very happy of the result.<br />
This project required:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GitHub: because I need GitHub pages and I also need to store my other projects in repositories.</li>
  <li>Git: because I use the version system control more than once.</li>
  <li>Jekyll: because it is very useful: the projects cards aren’t hardcoded, they are generated automatically from a markdown file I am writing in right now. (If you are interested go check the repository).</li>
  <li>Bulma: because I love working with frameworks, and they make it really easy to create modern and styley elements like the navbar or the cards.</li>
  <li>Html: for obvious reasons; i need to make the structure of the site.</li>
  <li>Css: for obvious reasons too; i need to make so things prettier because Bulma is cool but it’s not perfect.</li>
  <li>Console: because I use it to navigate through branches, to commit, to push, to pull, etc…</li>
  <li>Vim: Vim is very useful; I use it to make small changes directly in console without having to open Visual Studio Code to correct a word that is mispelled for example.</li>
</ul>
