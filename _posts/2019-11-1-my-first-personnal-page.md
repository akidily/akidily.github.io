This is probably the oldest project i've ever made. I made it using html and bootstrap.

I did it to learn how do frameworks work, what are the point of them, how to use them, and how to make them included in the webpage.  
Here's what it looks like:

This project required:  
 - HTML : for the front end
 - CSS : for some styles bootstrap couldn't work with
 - Bootstrap : to make it easier
