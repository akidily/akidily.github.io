I made a blog following a tutorial. It helped me understanding Jekyll.

This was super helpful because Jekyll was non-sense to me before i did [this tutorial.](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) 
I didn't make the content of the site. I was only copy-pasting pre-made html, css and jekyll language to understand how it works.
Here's what it looks like:

If you are interested, the link to the repository is below but i want to warn you that i had no clue how to use git properly. I would push every modification just to test if it works as it should... So the commit history is ðŸ¤®.  
This project requiered: 
 - Git : to commit changes
 - Jekyll : to build the blog
